# Projet_Pokemon
**Rules:** The projects will be done by groups of 4 (or 5) students. You will need to upload exactly 5 files. The
python scripts for the projects will be named exclusively `stockTrends.py` and `pokemonYearbook.py` , respectively.
The automatically generated pokemon « yearbook » must be in PDF format and will be named exclusively
`PYearbook.pdf` . The log file should be a plain text file named exclusively `PYlog.txt` . A requirement file
( `requirements.txt` ) is also demanded. Requirement files can be generated automatically (your task is to find out
how). A `requirements.txt` example is provided at the end of this document. Any change in file names will be
penalised. Other files besides the scripts, the « Yearbook », the log file and the requirements file will not be
considered.
## 1. Stock Trends
### General description:
Acquiring stock data for a period of time and visualising them represent important aspects for financial data
analysis. Thus, this project aims to load stock prices data, for a specific company, during a specific period of
time, and to generate a graph that would illustrate the trends.

## 2. Pokemon Yearbook
### General description:
Knowing how to deal with various file formats is a valued skill. The JSON format is widely used, especially by app
APIs. Thus, practicing the manipulation of JSON files is crucial for data scientists.
Generating curated, proper and clear PDF reports is also important for data scientists. The reports may be, in
most of the times, automatically generated.
Having all this in mind, this project aims at obtaining pokemon information from a distant JSON file and at
automatically generating a pokemon « yearbook » in PDF format.
